# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-event-data

Objective: Analyse and visualise data from a fictitious college club to derive insights on
income, expenses, events, and member participation.

Data Sets: You are provided with datasets based on the schema shared below. The
datasets include information about Income, Members, Attendance, Events, Expenses,
Budgets associated with each event and Major details of members.

Tasks:
Data Wrangling:
● Cleanse the data to handle missing values.
● Transform data types where necessary.
● Create a consolidated dataset linking income, members’ information including their
major and zip codes, attendance records for events and associated expenses.

Data Analysis:
● Analyse trends in income sources.
● Evaluate expense patterns related to different events.
● Assess member participation in various events based on their major or location (zip
code).
● Further analyse the data, run statistical tests and modelling to generate insights

Data Visualization using R or Python or Power BI:

● Create visualisations to represent trends in income and expenses over time.
● Visualise member attendance at various events by major or location (zip code).
● Develop plots that highlight correlations between event budgets and actual
expenses.

Dashboarding: Create an interactive dashboard using tools compatible with
R/Python/Power BI that includes:
● Time series plot of incomes and expenses
● Breakdown of event attendance by major
● A heatmap of budget vs actual expense for each event
